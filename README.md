## About  
This is a small maze game created in 2016 where the maze is procedurally generated. In the game, you start at the top left corner of the maze and the end is in the bottom right corner. You can only see a few cells around your character making it difficult to know where you are going and where you have been. The generation of the maze uses an algorithm called recursive division and always has exactly one solution.  

## How to Play  
Run the JAR file to get the game going. Use the arrow keys to move your character one space at a time. If you would like to cheat and see the whole maze: Press E.
